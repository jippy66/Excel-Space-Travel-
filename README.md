     o Concatenating every csv in the Dataset folder and connecting to the workbook using Power Query. 
     
     o This will create a pivot table and is used for the dynamicity of the data.
     
     o Toggle button to visualize the data in Tabular view.
     
     o Creating Necessary Charts, Sparklines, and Graphs, formatted with pleasing aesthetics. 
     
     o Creating Slicers for filtering the data.
